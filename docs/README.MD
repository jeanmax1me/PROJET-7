# Benchmark Results

## Main Search by User Input

When searching by user input, the performance of different algorithms was measured. The benchmark results indicate:

- **For Loop:** Outperforming the Filter Method by 100% to 98.86%.

This suggests that utilizing a traditional for loop for the main search operation provides better performance compared to using the filter method.

## Search by Filters in Dropdowns

Similarly, when searching by filters in dropdowns, the benchmark results reveal:

- **Filter Method:** Outperforming the For Loop by 100% to 99.36%.

In this scenario, using the filter method for search operations in dropdowns demonstrates superior performance compared to employing a for loop.

These benchmark results are essential for optimizing and fine-tuning the search functionalities of the application. Adjustments can be made based on these findings to enhance the overall efficiency of the search algorithms.
